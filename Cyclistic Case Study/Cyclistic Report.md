# Cyclistic Report
How do member and casual customers differ? How are their trips different? 

By definition, casual customers are classified by single-ride or full-day passes. Because of this, the analysis I carried out was performed after splitting the data into two categories: trips that lasted less than 1 day and trips that lasted for longer. I also felt it necessary to only investigate trips lasting longer than 1 minute, quelling my concern of false trips. 

# Historical Trends
## Trips Lasting Less than 1 Day

As one can see, the analysis yielded interesting results. Overall, members make more trips than casual customers. However, both categories make more trips during the warmer months than they do in the colder months. This isn't very suprising, but confirmation of this trend is comforting. Take note of the sheer drop of casual trips that starts in October 2022. It would be useful to gather more information about what motivates members to take bike rides in fall and winter.

Figures 2 and 3 call attention to how long these bike rides are taking, on average. Interestingly, the average durations of casual trips are longer than those of member trips. Both types typically get longer on Saturday and Sunday, as one might expect. Similarly, both types also get longer in the warmer months. We can also see the April 2023 column refelcting the trend of longer rides in warmer months for 2023 as well. 

## Trips Lasting More than 1 Day

In this section it is revealed that there is a great disparity between member and casual trips that are longer than 1 day. Evidently, it is  rare for members to take trips that last longer than a day. The reason for this is uncertain, and perhaps a survey could be used for further investigation. Regardless, the contrast here is certainly intriguing. 

## Types of Bikes

    Figure 6: Count of Bike Types per Trip Type
    
I saw fit to do away with the constraint of trips being longer or shorter than a day for this analysis. It felt unecessary considering my interest was in what types of bikes are more popular. Figure 6 shows that members tend to use classic bikes (although one could argue that the classic:electric ratio is almost 1:1). There are certainly more casual trips with electric bikes than there are those with classic bikes. Finally, it seems that members did not use docked bikes at all in the past year. 

# Conclusion
This analysis was a precursory one, meant to deliver insights toward later investigations. Now, Cyclistic can confidently say that there is a distinct difference between member and casual trips. Members take more trips, but their rides are shorter than casual customers. On the other hand, casual trips tend to last longer and even go on for more than a day. This means they would be charged for multiple full-day passes upon finishing their trip. 

I recommend surveying the customer pool and asking a few questions. This data alone cannot convert casual customers into members, but it does provide a thread to follow. Why do customers prefer bikes? It could be for health, convenience, or novelty. In this investigation, I found that members still ride bikes in colder seasons. What motivates them to do so, and could that be marketed toward the casual base? Are casual customers aware of the money they could save by forgoing passes and becoming members, instead? Exactly how much could they save? 

These are questions that could be answered with more data. Stakeholders will need to decide where they would like to go from here, based on my recommendations.
