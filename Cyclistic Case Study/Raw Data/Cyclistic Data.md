# Relevant Data
This data is provided by the Divvy bikeshare company, based in Chicago. The scenario surrounding the case study is fictional, and provided by the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program. Via this [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement) I am able to use Divvy's data for my own analysis. 

In this folder, the raw data used for the analysis can be found, separated by month. Unfortunately, the warmer months **June 2022 - Sept 2022** are too large to upload to Github, even while compressed. They can be found [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) if necessary.
