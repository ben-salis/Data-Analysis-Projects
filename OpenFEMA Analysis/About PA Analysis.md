# About Open FEMA
This analysis is one of a few that I intend to add to this portfolio. They will serve as examples of some of my work while being an analyst for FEMA. Naturally, I can't provide every project I've worked on but I can do my best while using publicly available data. 

Open FEMA is where the agency houses datasets for the public to view and peruse. Recently, the visualizations available there have been removed. It's been a rocky year, admittedly. Still, the datasets remain and I'm familiar with them. Where my work projects might involve private data, I will substitute for applicable public data and create mock reports. I'm fortunate that a lot of my work involved FEMA's databases in conjunction with public data (Census, National Inventory of Dams, USGS river gauge data, National Bridge Inventory, to name a few). 

Recreating some of my analyses should be easier with that in mind.

## Notebook
The PA Analysis seeks to take a look back at Public Assistance projects. FEMA used to handle grants through a program named **EMMIE**. This was later replaced in 2017 with **Grants Manager**. Around that time, policy changes had us interested in a few questions. For the purposes of this portfolio, I will provide my analysis and clarify some results as appropriate. 

The two datasets (split from PA Project Details) are not the same size, since EMMIE had a longer stint in FEMA. Still, the question is whether their differences are **significant**. A T-test will be employed at the end discover this.
